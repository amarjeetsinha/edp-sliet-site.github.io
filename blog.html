			<h1 style="text-align: center;">THING YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE A START-UP</h1>
			<img src="blog img/1.png" class="center" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;">
			<p>Starting your own business is something many people only dream about. You can be your own boss, work when and where you want to, and you will reap all the rewards of your efforts. On the flip side, though, you will find that your own business will take up more of your time than you realize. It’s a lot more stressful than people think. If you are about to embark on a business venture, you need to prepare for the negatives as well as the positives. So, here are things you need to know about being an entrepreneur.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Cash is the king</h2>
			<img src="blog img/2.png" class="center" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;">
			<p>Whatever type of business you start, you will soon find that you can’t ignore the accounts. Doing a great job and getting paid for it are two different things. Keeping track of your cash flow will become a regular task. The cash that is coming into the business is your key performance indicator. It’s not your sales or your accounting profit. You will need to monitor cash daily to ensure that your business stays on track.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Customers aren’t your friends</h2>
			<img src="blog img/3.png" class="center" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;">			
			<p>Building good relationships with customers is an essential part of running your own business. However, don’t think that all your customers will become your best friends. Business relationships are very different from personal relationships. They are, after all, relationships founded on money.</p><br>
			<h3>Running a Small Business Is a 24/7 Affair</h3>
			<p>The idea of working when you want to may sound great. The truth is, though, you will be thinking about your business 24/7, even when you are not working. You will need to consciously switch off sometimes. It’s important that you get quality relaxation time while you are making your business work.</p>
			<h3>You Will Be Tempted to Run Before You Can Walk</h3>
			<p>here will be occasions when success could make you a bad decision maker. It is important to remember that one good month does not make a great year. Don’t be impetuous. Make decisions based on long-term trends. Not on the excitement of a short-term windfall.</p>
			<h3>Employees Are Hard Work and Expensive</h3>
			<p>As your business grows, you may want to hire employees. Think very carefully before you do this. Employees need management and they must be paid. If you need an extra pair of hands, consider hiring temporary workers instead of full-time employees.</p>
			<h3>Hiring Friends and Family Is a Big Mistake</h3>
			<p>You might think that friends and family would make good employees or business partners. They can, but they can also be a major problem for an entrepreneur. Mixing your social life with your business life is fraught with problems. Could you reprimand or fire your spouse at work and it not affect your personal relationship? </p>
			<h3>You Will Need to Be Brutal with Time Management</h3>
			<p>When you are running your own business there will always be something that needs doing. You will need to plan each day to ensure that the important tasks are completed. Don’t let what you want to do take priority over what must be done. </p>
			<h3>Know When to Quit</h3>
			<p>Your own business is your baby. You will want to nurture it and see it succeed. Even so, you must always be prepared to walk away if the business isn’t working. Pumping more and more of your own cash into a failing business won’t work. If a business fails and you get out soon enough, though, you may be able to move on to your next business idea.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Running your own business can be very rewarding, but you do need to be realistic and disciplined. Business is rarely all plain sailing. Success can bring you financial rewards and great YYYYpersonal satisfaction. However, you need to prepare for a few stormy seas along the way as well. Enter entrepreneurship with a realistic outlook. Then, you will be much better placed to make your business a success.</p>

		<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Now it is a well-known fact that what we call 'marketing' has undergone substantial changes over the recent years and the key role in this transformation has been played by internet. Internet "refers to the physical network that links computers across the globe. It consists of the infrastructure of network servers and wide–area communication links between them that are used to hold and transport the vast amount of information on the internet".studies have addressed the way in which introduction of internet have reshaped the structure and performance of different sectors, e.g. hospitality, travel and tourism. 
		Introduction of internet has changed the rules and marketing practioners have no way but to adhere to it.In fact marketing is just one of numerous fields have been substantially revolutionized by internet-based technological innovations. Halloway maintains that "Information and communication technology, as it is now known, has come to play a key role in all elements of the marketing mix, and the new term recognizes the importance of communication in the interface between a business and its customers"The most prominent point is it has brought about a turning point, a complete shift to a new business model, which results in an inevitable reconceptualization of the very nature of marketing.

		<h3>WHAT IS ONLINE MARKETING?</h3>
		
		
		<p>Online marketing is any effort to spread the word about your practice using internet to reach people.anything you do online to get more attention and grab people's attention which should hopefully,at sometime be patients of your practice.online marketing includes a wider range of marketing elements than traditional marketing due to the extra channels and marketing mechanisms available</p>
	<br>
	<h3>BACKGROUND OF ONLINE MARKETING</h3>
	<p>Internet has its origins in cold war and technological rivalry between USSR and US. In fact "while the World Wide Web was created in 1991, its origin dates back to 1957 when the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik I satellite". US reacted with establishment a department of Defense Advanced Rsearch Project Agency (DARPA) which launched in 1960s ARPANET, an experimental project of computer networks from which what we now know as internet developed. Since then internet contributed to science incredibly and "by the late 1980s the internet was being used by many government and educational institutions" </p><p>So internet was considered an inclusive communicative tool of scientific and research centers for several years and its academic function was its dominant prior to discovering its commercial capabilities which led to its commercialization. As Oksana (2007) puts it: "until the mid-nineties, the research and academic communities accounted for most of the internet population but the commercialization of internet soon gained enormous momentum and the business community quickly became aware of the potential it has to offer".</p><p>With increasing the number of internet users during the 1990s, entrepreneurs started to appreciate commercial prospects of this new medium. Although there is no complete consensus on when did internet marketing exactly start, but the majority of commentators refer to 1994. So it is widely held that "significant commercial use of the Internet began with the first 'banner ads‘ on web pages in 1994, and the appearance of Internet-based 'malls‘ (the electronic equivalent of a storefront) such as Amazon.com in 1995".</p><p>Statistics make it clear that this young marketplace, online marketing, has had an astonishing rate of growth. So amazing is the growth rate of this new paradigm of marketing that it is hard to believe how young it is. In fact "in 1994, spending for internet marketing totaled nearly nothing, but increased to over $300 million in 1995. After a decade later, marketing spending and internet marketing business has exploded to nearly $500 billion (according to Forrester Research). Today, it‘s hard to believe in having an organization which doesn‘t have some kind of online presence." </p>
