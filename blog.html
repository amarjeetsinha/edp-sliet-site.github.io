		<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Now it is a well-known fact that what we call 'marketing' has undergone substantial changes over the recent years and the key role in this transformation has been played by internet. Internet "refers to the physical network that links computers across the globe. It consists of the infrastructure of network servers and wide–area communication links between them that are used to hold and transport the vast amount of information on the internet".studies have addressed the way in which introduction of internet have reshaped the structure and performance of different sectors, e.g. hospitality, travel and tourism. 
		Introduction of internet has changed the rules and marketing practioners have no way but to adhere to it.In fact marketing is just one of numerous fields have been substantially revolutionized by internet-based technological innovations. Halloway maintains that "Information and communication technology, as it is now known, has come to play a key role in all elements of the marketing mix, and the new term recognizes the importance of communication in the interface between a business and its customers"The most prominent point is it has brought about a turning point, a complete shift to a new business model, which results in an inevitable reconceptualization of the very nature of marketing.

		<h3>WHAT IS ONLINE MARKETING?</h3>
		
		
		<p>Online marketing is any effort to spread the word about your practice using internet to reach people.anything you do online to get more attention and grab people's attention which should hopefully,at sometime be patients of your practice.online marketing includes a wider range of marketing elements than traditional marketing due to the extra channels and marketing mechanisms available</p>
	<br>
	<h3>BACKGROUND OF ONLINE MARKETING</h3>
	<p>Internet has its origins in cold war and technological rivalry between USSR and US. In fact "while the World Wide Web was created in 1991, its origin dates back to 1957 when the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik I satellite". US reacted with establishment a department of Defense Advanced Rsearch Project Agency (DARPA) which launched in 1960s ARPANET, an experimental project of computer networks from which what we now know as internet developed. Since then internet contributed to science incredibly and "by the late 1980s the internet was being used by many government and educational institutions" </p><p>So internet was considered an inclusive communicative tool of scientific and research centers for several years and its academic function was its dominant prior to discovering its commercial capabilities which led to its commercialization. As Oksana (2007) puts it: "until the mid-nineties, the research and academic communities accounted for most of the internet population but the commercialization of internet soon gained enormous momentum and the business community quickly became aware of the potential it has to offer".</p><p>With increasing the number of internet users during the 1990s, entrepreneurs started to appreciate commercial prospects of this new medium. Although there is no complete consensus on when did internet marketing exactly start, but the majority of commentators refer to 1994. So it is widely held that "significant commercial use of the Internet began with the first 'banner ads‘ on web pages in 1994, and the appearance of Internet-based 'malls‘ (the electronic equivalent of a storefront) such as Amazon.com in 1995".</p><p>Statistics make it clear that this young marketplace, online marketing, has had an astonishing rate of growth. So amazing is the growth rate of this new paradigm of marketing that it is hard to believe how young it is. In fact "in 1994, spending for internet marketing totaled nearly nothing, but increased to over $300 million in 1995. After a decade later, marketing spending and internet marketing business has exploded to nearly $500 billion (according to Forrester Research). Today, it‘s hard to believe in having an organization which doesn‘t have some kind of online presence." </p>
